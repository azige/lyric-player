How to make a lrc file:\n\
1) Click "Raw Lyric" button and input the plain lyric text.\n\
   Each line will be converted to a lyric event.\n\
   * Notice that will completely override the existing lyric events.\n\
2) Play the media and click "Tag" button at the very beginning of a selected event.\n\
   The event will be tagged with current time. You can double click a event and\n\
   the player will seek to 3 seconds earlier by the time of the event.\n\
3) Click "Meta Info" button to set the meta info of the lyric, such as title,\n\
   artist, etc.\n\
4) Click "Save" button to save the lrc file. The file will be named with the same\n\
   name of the media file while the extension will be ".lrc" instead.
